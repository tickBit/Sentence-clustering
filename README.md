# Sentence clustering

I got inspiration to try to cluster a Wikipedia page's sentences according to semantic similarity. Some kind of "poor man's topic modeling".

## Might not work in Windows

I haven't been able to succesfully load the WebBertSimilarity class' model in Windows in "Sentence-clustering.ipynb". In Linux this works fine.

"Sentence-clustering-spaCy.ipynb" should work both in Windows and Linux.
